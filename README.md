<h2> ðŸš² Flying Wheels Project </h2>

Flying Wheels is a marketplace for bike rentals (in a similar vein to Airbnb). With regard to features, the app allows users to list bikes, see all bikes (including individual details) and then make a booking, if required. The app also has a dashboard that allows users to see a summary of their booking activity and a place for owners to accept/reject the bookings that they have received.

The web app is mobile-responsive.
